A ShortUrl is a service that translates long URLs into abbreviated alternatives. ShortUrl services are based on URL redirection.

ShortUrl are preferable for a number of reasons. Longer ones are often broken in email messages, for example, and may not work reliably. Furthermore, for some types of communications, such as text messaging and posting to Twitter, the number of characters permitted per post is so limited that including a long URL would leave no room for a message to accompany it.
